# MGS_Pebble
This is my Pebble Time version of preman_pasar's Amazfit Metal Gear Solid watch face.

The signal strength indicator is used to display the Pebble's battery. Each increment represents approximately 
15 percent of the watch's battery.

The user's steps and distance traveled (in meters) metrics are displayed in the lower center portion of the 
screen.

Requires a Pebble Time watch and a Rebble account to download. Pebble classics are not supported.
